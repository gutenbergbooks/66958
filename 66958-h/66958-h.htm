<p>Larger versions of most illustrations may be seen by right-clicking them
and selecting an option to view them separately, or by double-tapping and/or
stretching them.</p>

<p>Pages in the original book were quite narrow, with large print;
and most pages included a large illustration at the top or bottom.
Viewing this ebook in a narrow window will approximate that original
design more closely than will a wide window.</p>

royal treasure, &amp; steered by the captured charts
of Spanish Admirals, the little ship that sailed as
the <i>Pelican</i>, comes home again as the <i>Golden Hind</i>.
She brings her fabulous booty and her still more
fabulous romance from Plymouth Sound to Deptford,
and then and there the great names of the
past—the <i>Christophers</i>, the <i>Great Harrys</i>, the
<i>Dragons</i> and the <i>Swans</i>—are all finally eclipsed.
Drake, kneeling upon her deck, receives his
knighthood from the hand of Gloriana, and the
<i>Golden Hind</i> herself, bidding farewell for ever to
wind and wave, is laid up as a national monument—“consecrated
to perpetuall Memory.”</p>

<p>She is remembered still, but it is hardly for her
own sake; her story is a part of Drake’s, and not
the greatest part. Question your Elizabethan
again some ten years later, and hers is no longer
the name that he will give you; he will speak of
things that are even nearer to his heart, and to
ours; for though an Englishman will always, I
suppose, lick his lips over a tale of treasure, it is
the fighting and not the plunder that he is really
fitted to enjoy, and in his imagination even the
jewels of the <i>Golden Hind</i> will shine with a less
bright and steady glow than the battle-lanterns
of the <i>Revenge</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Revenge</i> is a part of no man; she saw many
captains and more triumphs than one. She had a
personality, as great ships always have; she had
a career, a life of her own. She has a life after
death; not only a posterity but a true survival.</p>

be on active service still. If the day ever comes
when she no longer helps to keep the sea for us,
it can only be when Time shall have paid off the
British Navy.</p>

<p>The last of her successes is more freshly remembered
by our friends than by ourselves. A neighbouring
potentate, whom pride in his English
descent had exhilarated to a pitch of splendid
audacity worthy of an Elizabethan, challenged
us by a telegram encouraging a vassal State to
throw off the suzerainty of the Queen. If the
message meant anything, it was a promise of
armed support; but the promise had none of the
Elizabethan hardihood to back it, and proved
bankrupt as soon as the Flying Squadron put to</p>

<p class="samepara">sea. It was not that this force was unknown, or
suddenly created; the ships had long been on the
Navy List, their names, guns, tonnage and complement
all as familiar to the German Kaiser as
to the rest of the world. But there was a sense
abroad of something more than brute strength:
a memory of great traditions, of inherited skill,
of undaunted and indomitable tenacity. When
on that January 15, 1896, the English Admiral
hoisted his flag in the <i>Revenge</i>, and Her Majesty’s
Marines marched on board under the command
of Captain Drake, the enemy disappeared from
the seas, and we made haste to forget another
naval victory.</p>

<p>The lesson, we may hope, remains; this was
not a triumph of physical force. The challenger’s
nerve, and not his ships, failed him; he feared his</p>

age even more materially minded, if possible, than
those which went before it, we are increasingly
diligent to measure our armour and our guns,
to reckon up our horse-power and the number of
our hits at target practice. It is not for any man
to blame us; we should be wrong if we neglected
these things, but we should be still more wrong
if we forgot for a moment that there were years
in our history when it was not we but our enemies
who had the advantage of armament, and that
whether by combination or otherwise, such a time
may come upon us again. Build as we will, we
cannot secure ourselves against it for ever; but we
can forestall it by facing it with the remembrance
of the past. It was by moral superiority that the</p>

<p class="samepara">Elizabethans came through their trial. The Spaniards
were contending to maintain their hold
upon the wealth of the world, and they fought
as men will fight in such a cause—courageously,
but not desperately; the English fought as, at
sea, they must always be fighting, for national
existence, and they took care—it was a great
part of their strength—to leave their enemies in
no doubt that they meant in every engagement
to make the affair fatal to one side or the other.
This is a policy which we did not follow in the
latest of our wars; we may have been justified,
we had our reasons, and we paid the full price;
but on the day when we abandon it upon the
sea, we shall have thrown away our only sure
defence and our deadliest weapon. Men and
nations are never so nearly invincible and never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
half so terrible as when they are armed with contempt
of death; and that such an ardent temper
can defy, discourage and destroy mere bulk or
numbers, “even beyond credit and to the Height
of some Heroicall Fable”—this is the meaning
of the last fight of the <i>Revenge</i>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap i"><span class="smcap large">It</span> was in 1577, the year in which
the <i>Golden Hind</i> sailed from Plymouth
on her ever-memorable
voyage, that the <i>Revenge</i> first
took the water. Probably, says
Arber (but I cannot find upon
what authority), she was built at Chatham by
Sir John Hawkins. According to Sir John
Laughton she was launched at Deptford. Ships</p>

<p class="samepara">are the children of predestination, as every sailor
knows: from the moment when they leave the
slips they are either lucky or unlucky. In the
opinion of the younger Hawkins the <i>Revenge</i> “was
ever the unfortunatest Ship the late Queene’s
Majestie had during her Raigne.” He supports
this view by a list of hairbreadth escapes, which
might as easily be quoted to prove her the especial
care of Providence, many times miraculously
preserved to be the scourge and dishonour of
the Queen’s enemies. First, says Sir Richard,
“Comming out of Ireland with Sir John Parrot,
she was like to be [but was not] cast away
upon the Kentish coast.” Then, in 1586, “in
the Voyage of Sir John Hawkins, she struck
aground coming into Plimouth, before her going</p>

<p class="samepara">to Sea”; but to sea she went nevertheless. Upon
the coast of Spain she was “readie to sinke with
a great Leake,” and (though she did not sink)
“at her return into the harbour of Plimouth,
she beat upon Winter Stone”—again without
fatality. She escaped a still greater danger when,
soon after, she twice ran aground in going out of
Portsmouth Haven, lay twenty-two hours beating
upon the shore, and was forced off with
eight feet of water in her, only to ground again
“upon the Oose,” where she stuck for six months,
until the following spring, testifying to the
skill of those who built and the clumsiness of
those who sailed her. Being at last got off and
brought round into the Thames to be docked,
“her old Leake breaking upon her, had like to</p>

<p class="samepara">have drowned all those which were in her.”
Neither then, however, nor in any of her mishaps,
does she appear to have actually drowned anyone,
not even when, in 1591, “with a storme of wind
and weather, riding at her moorings in the river
of Rochester, nothing but her bare Masts overhead,
shee was turned topse-turvie, her Kele
uppermost.” One might have thought that this
final proof of her indestructibility would convince
her detractor. Drake, at any rate, knew a
good sea-boat when he saw one, for he chose
her for his flagship when he sailed against the
Armada as Vice-Admiral, and the Calendar of
State Papers contains, under the date of November,
1588, a “Device of Lord Admiral Howard,
Sir F. Drake, Sir W. Wynter, Sir John Hawkyns,
Capt. Wm. Borough and others, for the construction
of four new ships to be built on the</p>

<p class="samepara">model of the <i>Revenge</i>, but exceeding her in
burthen.” (She was but of 500 tons herself, and
carried at most 260 men and forty guns.) To this
evidence we may add the statement of a Spanish
prisoner, bearing the delightful name of Gonsalo
Gonsalez del Castillo, who writes in 1592 that
in England “they have been much pained by
the loss of one of the Queen’s galleons, called
the <i>Revenge</i>; they say she was the best ship the
Queen had, and the one in which they had the
most confidence for her defence.”</p>

<p>Such was the <i>Revenge</i>, and, if she had her
share of misfortune she had also her full share of
prosperous service. She bore Drake’s flag as Vice-Admiral
from January 3, 1588. On May 23, at
the head of sixty sail, she escorted the Lord Admiral
Howard into Plymouth; then, till July 12,</p>

<p class="samepara">she watched and longed for the “felicisima
Armada.” On Saturday the 20th, while the
enemy crept up Channel in heavy rain, and the
wind fell lighter and lighter, she tacked and
tacked her way out painfully through a night of
deadly anxiety. She had her reward. On Sunday,
“conspicuous with an extravagant pennant and
a banner on her mizzen, and fighting almost at
grappling distance,” she battered Don Juan Martinez
de Recalde in the <i>Santa Anna</i>. Towards
evening the Admirals held Council on board her;
when night fell her lantern led the fleet, until
Drake, finding himself among strange sail, extinguished
it and lay by for daylight. Howard
and the rest went after the Spanish lights, and
when dawn came the <i>Revenge</i> found herself alone,</p>

<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Nuestra Señora del Rosario</i>, flagship of Don Pedro
de Valdes, Captain-General of the Andalusian
Squadron and one of Sidonia’s best officers. The
Captain-General was “spoiled of his mast the day
before,” and had smashed his bowsprit in collision;
but he tried to stand out for conditions of
surrender. The Vice-Admiral replied that he was
Drake, and had no time to parley. That ended
the matter; the galleon went into Dartmouth
“under the conduction of the <i>Roebuck</i>” and the
<i>Revenge</i> “bare with the Lord Admiral, and recovered
his Lordship that night, being Monday.”
Aboard of her went poor Don Pedro and forty of
his officers; also their cash, to the tune of fifty
thousand ducats.</p>

<p>On Tuesday the 23rd, the prisoners, or those
of them who were allowed on deck, witnessed
the battle off the Isle of Wight, the failure of the
galleasses with their countless oars, and the rescue
of the <i>Triumph</i>, in which our first <i>Victory</i> and our
first <i>Dreadnought</i> distinguished themselves. They
saw, too, in the bird-like line-ahead flights of
the <i>Revenge</i> and her consorts, their quick concentrations
and dispersals, what Mr Julian Corbett
has described as “the first dawn of those
modern tactics which Blake and Monk were to
develop and Nelson to perfect.” By the end of the
day they were probably all deaf; the unknown
eyewitness who wrote the <cite>Relation of Proceedings</cite>
for Howard, declares that “there was never seen
a more terrible value of great shot, nor more hot
fight than this was; for although the musketeers</p>

<p class="samepara">and harquebusiers of crock were then infinite,
yet could they not be discerned nor heard for
that the great ordnance came so thick that a man
would have judged it to have been a hot skirmish
of small shot, being all the fight long within half
musket shot of the enemy.”</p>

<p>On the 24th fresh ammunition arrived, and
the fleet was divided into four squadrons, of
which <i>Revenge</i> was to lead the second.</p>

<p>On Thursday the 25th, in a calm, the galleasses
ventured again and were finally knocked out of
the fight. For the next two days “the Spaniards
went always before the English Army like sheep”
until on Saturday evening they suddenly came
to an anchor off Calais.</p>

<p>On the night of Sunday the 28th, the Lord
Admiral “caused eight ships to be fired and let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
drive amongst the Spanish fleet; whereupon they
were forced to let slip or cut cables at half and
to set sail.” When day came, Howard stopped
to take a prize, and it was the <i>Revenge</i> who led
the last great chase northwards, pounding Sidonia
himself in the huge <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">San Martin</i>, sinking,
scattering and driving ashore his followers. “It
was the hour,” says Mr Corbett, “for which
Francis Drake had been born.” But glorious as
it was, it was not yet the hour for which the
<i>Revenge</i> had been built.</p>

solemn prayers,” charging furiously “both down
the one hill and up the other” at Bradock Down;
or again dying on the brow of Lansdowne Hill,
after he had stormed it in the face of cannon,
“small shot from the breastworks” and “two
full charges from the enemy’s horse.”</p>

Grenville family living of Kilkhampton, in defiance,
it would appear, of the lawful patron’s
rights. Sir Theobald made war at once in the
best Grenville manner. At dawn on Sunday,
March 24, 1347, he invaded the Manor of
Bishop’s Tawton with 500 followers “armed
with divers kinds of weapons, offensive and
defensive, after the fashion of men going to mortal
war.” They stormed the Manor-house, the Sanctuary
and the Manse; killed some of the defenders,
took plunder to the value of two hundred marks
(the Bishop’s estimate) and otherwise “multipliciter
perturbarunt pacem et tranquillitatem
Domini nostri Regis.” The Bishop’s peace and
tranquillity being also disturbed, he at once excommunicated
the entire army. Sir Theobald</p>

to Rome, with the inevitable result; the King’s
Bench judgement was annulled, with costs against
Sir Theobald. Cheered by this, the Bishop sent
the Abbot of Hartland and the Prior of Launceston
to Kilkhampton one fine July day to put
things to rights. The Grenville army, with faces
masked and painted, bows bent and arrows
notched, met the Church Militant in a narrow
lane and routed it shamefully; the pursuit lasted
for a mile, and Sir Theobald then fortified and
held Kilkhampton Church for several days. After
eighteen months more of contumacy, peace was
made; from the terms we may judge how hard the
Grenville had pressed his tremendous adversary.

<p class="samepara">there was no denying that—but the Bishop, in
return for this preservation of his dignity, had
to revoke his own institution and admit a new
rector upon Sir Theobald’s presentation; Raleigh
got nothing but the barren pleasure of reading
aloud the Act of Submission. The significant
points of the story are to me, first, that this boy
of twenty-two gained his end in the teeth of all
Rome; second, that to gain it he cared not what
he did or suffered; and last, that it was never
worth the money or the crimes it cost him.</p>

apparently, of government. Letters from Lane,
the head of the colony, to Secretary Walsingham,
and dispatches from the treasurer to Raleigh himself,
set forth Grenville’s “intolerable pride” and
his “insatiable ambition.” His behaviour to his
subordinates was such that they desire to be freed
from any place where he is to carry any authority
in chief. But what an irresistible fighter he is! On
the homeward voyage he falls in with “a Spanish
ship of 300 tunne, richly loaden”; having no
boats, he boards her with an improvised one,
“made with boards of chests, which fell a sunder,
and sunke at the shippes side as soone as ever
he and his men were out of it.” He reached</p>

in the following April, when the Justices of
Cornwall report to the Council, Sir Richard
having evidently neglected to do so, that, “being
about to depart to sea, he has left his charge of
300 men to George Greynvil.” On this voyage
he sacked the Azores, took “divers Spanyardes”
and performed “many other exploytes,” but he
reached Virginia too late to be of any service to
the colony, which had already left for England.
Then came the business of the Armada, in which
he had at least three ships of his own engaged,
though he got little chance of distinguishing
himself in his station off the coast of Devon
and Cornwall. His next voyage was that in the
<i>Revenge</i>: and here again, in the one memorable
action of his life, we cannot but see the working<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
of the peculiar character which is visible in all

<p>“This Sir Richard Greenfield was a great and
a rich Gentleman in England,” says a contemporary,
the Dutchman Linschoten, “and had
great yearly revenewes of his owne inheritance:
but he was a man very unquiet in his minde,
and greatly affected to warre: in so much as of
his owne private motion he offered his service
to the Queene: he had performed many valiant
acts, and was greatly feared in these Islands [i.e.,
the Azores], and knowne of every man, but of
nature very severe, so that his owne people hated
him for his fiercenes and spake verie hardly of
him: for when they first entered into the Fleete
or Armado, they had their great sayle in a readinesse,
and might possiblie enough have sayled</p>

<p class="samepara">away: for it [i.e., the <i>Revenge</i>] was one of the
best ships for sayle in England, and the Master
perceiving that the other shippes had left them,
and followed not after, commanded the great
sayle to be cut, that they might make away:
but Sir Richard Greenfield threatened both him,
and all the rest that were in the ship, that if any
man laid hand upon it, he would cause him to
be hanged, and so by that occasion they were
compelled to fight, and in the end were taken.”</p>

<p>Sir William Monson, another contemporary,
has left behind him a similar account, first printed
in 1682. “Upon view of the Spaniards, which
were 55 sail, the Lord Thomas warily, and like
a discreet General, weighed Anchor, and made</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<div id="ip_50" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37em;">
  <img src="images/i_050.jpg" width="1775" height="848" alt="" /></div>

<p class="samepara">signs to the rest of his Fleet to do the like, with
a purpose to get the wind of them: but Sir
Richard Grenvile, being a stubborn man, ...
would by no means be persuaded by his Master,
or Company, to cut his main Sail, to follow the
Admiral: nay, so headstrong and rash he was,
that he offered violence to those that counselled
him thereto.”</p>

<p>Sir Walter Raleigh, Grenville’s kinsman, friend
and apologist, tells substantially the same story,
but he endeavours to throw a different complexion
upon it, by representing Sir Richard as
being in the first instance trapped in the fulfilment
of a duty. He declares that the <i>Revenge</i>
“was the last waied, to recover the men that
were upon the Island, which otherwise had been</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<hr class="pagetop" />

<div id="ip_51" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37em;">
  <img src="images/i_051.jpg" width="1764" height="996" alt="" /></div>

<p class="samepara">lost.” Unfortunately, this contention is negatived
by the numbers of the men captured in
her; and, indeed, he goes on to say that Grenville
afterwards “utterly refused to turn from
the enemy” and boasted that he would “enforce
those of Sivill to give him way.” Sir Richard
Hawkins is more whole-hearted. “At the Ile
of Flores, Sir Richard Greenfield got eternall
honour and reputation of great valour, and of
an experimented Soldier, chusing rather to sacrifice
his life, and to passe all danger whatsoever,
than to fayle in his Obligation, by gathering
together those which had remained ashore in
that place, though with the hazard of his ship
and companie: and rather we ought to imbrace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
an honourable death than to live with infamie
and dishonour, by fayling in dutie.”</p>

<hr class="pagetop" />

<div id="ip_52" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37em;">
  <img src="images/i_052.jpg" width="1775" height="968" alt="" /></div>

<p>No man would have been quicker to lay down
such a principle than Grenville, but it is clear
that on this occasion he did not observe it, and
to maintain that he did so would be to mistake
the nature of the man. He was no quiet resolute
victim of duty: his stubbornness was not
that of faithful endurance. If the evidence we
have quoted goes for anything he was then, as
ever, proud, rash, headstrong and tyrannical, and
he remained true to himself even in his famous
dying speech, which has been garbled by every
translator for 300 years. “Here die I, Richard
Greenfield, with a joyfull and quiet mind, for
that I have ended my life as a true soldier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
ought to do, that hath fought for his country,
Queene, religion, and honor, whereby my soule
most joyfull departeth out of this bodie, and
shall alwaies leave behind it an everlasting fame
of a valiant and true soldier, that hath done his
dutie, as he was bound to do.” So it has always
run; it was not until 1897 that Mr David Hannay
first translated and replaced the fierce concluding
sentence: “But the others of my company
have done as traitors and dogs, for which they
shall be reproached all their lives and leave a
shameful name for ever.” That, to my ear, is
the authentic voice of the Grenville.</p>

Richard Grenville of the <i>Revenge</i>,
after three centuries of fame, to
be summed up as a ferocious and
domineering fire-eater, hateful
to his subordinates and disobedient
to his chief? I do not think so. It is true
that we cannot look to him for an example of
what a seaman should be, or what an officer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
should do, but he is none the less a beacon to all
Englishmen, because he was a great fighter and
above the fear of death. To breathe the inspiration
of his genius, it is not necessary to tamper
with the record of his character; we have but
to look at him as he was, with open eyes, to
think what we will of his faults, and then to turn
once more to the story of his superb valour and
his supreme achievement. Beyond question, he
and all his company are among the Immortals.</p>

Sir Richard to have care of them,
alleging that the Spaniard would be as
ready to entertain a composition, as they

his dangerous disposition: yielded
that all their lives should be saved, the
company sent for England, and the better
sort to pay such reasonable ransom as their
estate would bear, and in the mean season
to be free from galley or imprisonment.
To this he so much the rather condescended

grown foul, unrummaged, and scarcely

If all the rest had entered, all had been

it is very true, that the Lord
Thomas would have entered between
the squadrons, but the rest would not

own ship offered to leap into the sea,
rather than to conduct that Her Majesty’s
ship and the rest to be a prey to the
enemy, where there was no hope nor
possibility either of defence or victory.
Which also in my opinion had ill sorted
or answered the discretion and trust of a

to an assured destruction, without hope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
or any likelihood of prevailing: thereby
to diminish the strength of Her Majesty’s
Navy, and to enrich the pride and glory

commanded by Thomas Vavasour, performed
a very great fight, and stayed two
hours as near the <i>Revenge</i> as the weather
would permit him, not forsaking the fight,
till he was like to be encompassed by the
squadrons, and with great difficulty
cleared himself. The rest gave divers volleys
of shot, and entered as far as the place
permitted and their own necessities, to

to be unnatural to his own country

To conclude, it hath ever to
this day pleased God to prosper and defend
her Majesty, to break the purposes of
malicious enemies, of foresworn traitors,
and of unjust practices and invasions. She
hath ever been honoured of the worthiest
Kings, served by faithful subjects, and
shall by the favour of God, resist, repel,

In the meantime, let the Spaniard and
traitor vaunt of their success; and we
her true and obedient vassals guided by

love her, serve her, and obey her
to the end of our lives.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
